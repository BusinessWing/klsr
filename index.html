        <p>I am not sure if this is ok to put my questions in installing HomeBrew here. if no good, please somebody tell me, I will try other way to solve my problem. @@</p>

<p>After I installed the Homebrew on Mac OSX, and run the brew doctor, what I've got is following warnings.. </p>

<h2>Please anyone help me out. I am very beginner on programing. </h2>

<p>Warning: Some directories in /usr/local/share/locale aren't writable.
This can happen if you "sudo make install" software that isn't managed
by Homebrew. If a brew tries to add locale information to one of these
directories, then the install will fail during the link step.
You should probably <code>chown</code> them:</p>
